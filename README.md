# KomputerStore
First Assignment of Noroff .NET Fullstack Bootcamp.
In this assignment we made web page for computer store where you can buy laptops.
You can buy laptops by gaining money or taking a loan.

This project was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
In this project I learned how to manipulate DOM with JavaScript and my JavaScript skills got better.
